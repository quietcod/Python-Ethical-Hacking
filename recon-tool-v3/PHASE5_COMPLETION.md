python3 main.py -t example.com --format all --report-type comprehensive

# Generate executive summary for management
python3 main.py -t example.com --format html --report-type executive
```

#### Report Management
```bash
# List all generated reports
python3 main.py --list-reports

# Clean up old reports (30+ days)
python3 main.py --cleanup-reports 30

# View report in browser
firefox results/reports/target_comprehensive_report.html
```

#### Integration Examples
```bash
# JSON output for automation
python3 main.py -t example.com --format json | jq '.summary.vulnerabilities'

# Batch processing with reporting
for domain in $(cat domains.txt); do
    python3 main.py -t $domain --format html --report-type executive
done
```
