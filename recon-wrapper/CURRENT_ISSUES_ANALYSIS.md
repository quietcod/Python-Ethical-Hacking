```

**Priority**: Low - Reports work but need polish

#### **⚙️ Tool Integration (5% Remaining)**
**Minor Issues**:
- Some optional tools missing (subfinder, nuclei, assetfinder)
- Masscan parameter order fixed but needs testing
- Tool timeout handling could be more granular
- Need better tool version detection

**Required Improvements**:
```python
def check_tool_versions(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # 1. Detect installed tool versions
    # 2. Check compatibility requirements
    # 3. Warn about outdated tools
    # 4. Suggest upgrade paths
```

**Priority**: Low - Core functionality works, these are enhancements

#### **🖥️ CLI Interface (5% Remaining)**
**Minor Improvements Needed**:
- Add `--version` flag
- Improve help text formatting
- Add command completion support
- Better error messages for invalid combinations

**Priority**: Low - Interface works well, these are polish items

        """Normalize results and correlate findings across tools"""
        
        # 1. Normalize different tool outputs
        normalized = self._normalize_tool_outputs(tool_results)
        
        # 2. Correlate findings (port + service + web findings)
        correlated = self._correlate_findings(normalized)
        
        # 3. Filter false positives
        filtered = self._filter_false_positives(correlated)

        return scored
```

### **🔧 LOW PRIORITY (Week 3+)**

#### **3. Report Generation Improvements**
```python
# File: recon_tool/reporting/enhanced_generator.py
def generate_report(self, scan_results: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    """Enhanced report generation with null safety"""
    
    # 1. Validate input data
    if not scan_results or not scan_results.get('results'):
        self.logger.warning("Empty scan results, generating minimal report")
        scan_results = self._create_minimal_results()
    
    # 2. Add null checks throughout template rendering
    # 3. Provide sensible defaults for missing data
    # 4. Improve error handling and logging
```

#### **4. Optional Tool Installation Helper**
```python
def install_missing_tools(self) -> Dict[str, bool]:
    """Help users install missing optional tools"""
    missing_tools = ['subfinder', 'nuclei', 'assetfinder']
    installation_results = {}
    
    for tool in missing_tools:
        if not check_tool_installed(tool):
            print(f"📦 Installing {tool}...")
            # Provide installation instructions or automation
```

#### **5. CLI Interface Enhancements**
```python
# Enhanced CLI features
def add_version_flag(self):
    parser.add_argument('--version', action='version', version='ReconTool v2.0')

def add_completion_support(self):
    # Add shell completion for bash/zsh
    pass
